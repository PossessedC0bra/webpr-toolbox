## Assignment: Using `eval()`

Your user has entered a new business rule on how to calculate
this year's bonuses. He entered a formula through a web form and it is available
through the `string` variable `bonusFormula`.
The formula refers to the employee as `employee` like in
`employee.bonus = employee.revenue * 0.2`

Provide a function (or lambda expression) named `bonusCalculation` that
calculates an employee's bonus by using the user-provided bonusFormula.

Do <b>NOT</b> use the "Function" class.

<RevealChildren>
    ```javascript copy showLineNumbers filename="Solution"
    const bonusCalculation = employee => eval(bonusFormula);
    ```
</RevealChildren>

Your solution will be tested against:

```javascript
const e = {revenue: 10000, bonus: null};
bonusCalculation(e);
e.bonus === e.revenue * factor_;
```
