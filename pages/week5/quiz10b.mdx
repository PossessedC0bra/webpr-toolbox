# Quiz 10b

## Assignment: Using `Function()`

Your user has entered a new business rule on how to calculate
this year's bonuses. He entered a formula through a web form and it is available
through the `string` variable `bonusFormula`.
The formula refers to the employee as `employee` like in
`employee.revenue * 0.2` (note that this only calculates but does not set the bonus)

Provide a function (or lambda expression) named `bonusCalculation` that
calculates an employee's bonus by using the user-provided bonusFormula.

Since we will give bonuses to many employees, do <b>NOT</b> use the `eval` function
and do <b>NOT</b> use side effects like setting surrounding variables.

<RevealChildren>
    ```javascript copy showLineNumbers filename="Solution"
    const bonusCalculation = employee => {
        const calc = new Function('employee', `return ${bonusFormula}`);
        employee.bonus = calc(employee);
    };
    ```
</RevealChildren>

Your solution will be tested against:
```javascript
const e = {revenue: 10000, bonus: null};
bonusCalculation(e);
e.bonus === e.revenue * factor_;
```
