## Assignment: Eta reductions, returning functions

Given

```javascript copy
const id  = y => y;
const fst = x => y => x;
```
We want to write `snd` such that it returns the second argument like

```javascript copy
const snd = x => y => y;
```
but we can only use `fst` and `id` (not `x` and `y`) for the implementation.
You might need eta operations to find the solution.
The start of the function definition is added for you. Provide the function body only.

```javascript copy
const snd = <your code will be added here>
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Do not write that initial part!
```

```javascript copy showLineNumbers filename="Solution"
fst(id);
```

Your solution will be tested against:
```javascript copy
const x_ = Math.random();
const y_ = Math.random();
snd(x_)(y_) === y_
```
