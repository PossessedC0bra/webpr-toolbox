## Assignment: curried function with => notation

<Assignment
    description={`Write a function named 'plus' that returns the sum of its arguments, where the arguments are being passed in curried style, such that for all numbers x and y, plus()(x)(y) === x + y.
Use the => notation exclusively, i.e. no "function" keyword.`}

    ```js copy showLineNumbers filename="JavaScript"
    const x_ = Math.random();
    const y_ = Math.random();
    const plus3 = plus(3);
    plus(x_)(y_) === x_ + y_ && plus3(y_) === 3 + y_;
