## Assignment: curried function with => notation

Write a function named `plus` that returns the sum of its arguments, where the arguments are being passed in curried style, such that for all numbers `x` and `y`, `plus(x)(y) === x + y`.
Use the `=>` notation exclusively, i.e. no `function` keyword.

<RevealChildren>
```javascript copy showLineNumbers filename="Solution"
const plus = x => y => x + y;
```
</RevealChildren>

Your solution will be tested against:

```js copy
const x_ = Math.random();
const y_ = Math.random();
const plus3 = plus(3);
plus(x_)(y_) === x_ + y_ && plus3(y_) === 3 + y_;
```
