## Assignment: filter

Provide a function (or lambda expression) named 'divides' such that

```javascript copy
[1,2,3,4,5,6].filter(divides(3)) equals [3,6]
```

<RevealChildren>
    ```javascript copy showLineNumbers filename="Solution"
    const divides = n => x => x % n === 0;
    ```
</RevealChildren>

Your solution will be tested against:

```javascript copy
[1,2,3,4,5,6].filter(divides(3)).toString() === "3,6"
```
